Mel Moreno and Jennifer Moore were tasked with compiling quadrat data and renaming stations by Bill.

They have some questions for Steve and we met on March 13 2019 to discuss.
-Looks like the old station names were in fact updated names.  The new station names appear correct, with the exception of Epoch 3 (new name) LCO2 and LCO4.  These stations were changed twice so the new names were incorrect.
-Jennifer is going to restore original station names for datasheet reference and make correction.
-Steve will do one final comparison with raw data sheets to ensure no data has been effected by renaming effort.
